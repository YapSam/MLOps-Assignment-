### Data Cleaning
#### I did some data cleaning for my dataset. There is this column name month. It is in YYYY/MM format. So I decided to split the year from the month column. The image below shows how I did it.

#### The end result:

#### I also removed columns with low feature importance. I did modeling with all the columns to find out columns with low importance. The image below shows the feature importance chart

#### Below shows the code I used to remove the columns

#### I also checked for null values

#### Comparing Models. My best Model is K-Neighbour Regression
